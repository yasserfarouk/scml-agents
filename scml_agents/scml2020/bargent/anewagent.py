This code is free to use or update given that proper attribution is given to 
the authors and the ANAC 2020 SCML. 

This module implements a factory manager for the SCM 2020 league of ANAC 2019 
competition. This version will use subcomponents. Please refer to the 
[game description](http://www.yasserm.com/scml/scml2020.pdf) for all the 
callbacks and subcomponents available.

Your agent can learn about the state of the world and itself by accessing 
properties in the AWI it has. For example:

- The number of simulation steps (days): self.awi.n_steps  
- The current step (day): self.awi.current_steps
- The factory state: self.awi.state
- Availability for producton: self.awi.available_for_production


Your agent can act in the world by calling methods in the AWI it has. 
For example:

- *self.awi.request_negotiation(...)*  # requests a negotiation with one partner
- *self.awi.request_negotiations(...)* # requests a set of negotiations

 
You can access the full list of these capabilities on the documentation.

- For properties/methods available only to SCM agents, check the list 
  [here](http://www.yasserm.com/scml/scml2020docs/api/scml.scml2020.AWI.html)
